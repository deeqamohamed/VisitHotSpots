        <h1>FOOD & DRINKS</h1>
        <br><br> Liverpool has a vast range of great restaurants, from Italian, to Mexican, to traditional English pub grub. For the foodies, we recommend a stroll around the Georgian Quarter, which has plenty of tasteful and unfussy bistros to wind down in. Check out <a href="https://www.papillonhopestreet.com/">Papillon</a> on Hope Street for simple, elegant food and a buzzing atmosphere. For the night owls, make sure to check out the bars in the <a href="https://baltictriangle.co.uk/cat/food/">Baltic Triangle</a> (fun fact: Peaky Blinders was filmed around there!). Or you could try your luck at speakeasy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/berryandrye/?hl=en">Berry & Rye</a> for inventive cocktails, live piano and a chilled vibe. Just make sure to knock at the right door…
